2️⃣ Run Receiver
   python receiver.py

It will print incoming GPS coordinates in real time:
  Received data: 17.446500,78.348000


⚠️ Notes

Ensure both LoRa modules use the same frequency and settings.
If using raw SX1278 modules (SPI-based), this code will not work directly. You’ll need an SPI LoRa library (e.g., pyLoRa).
Serial ports may differ; update in code:
LoRa → /dev/ttyS0
GPS → /dev/ttyUSB0
